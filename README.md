##  Contributing

First, you will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and reboot. Afterwards, you will need to install `mkdocs-material`, and [`mike`](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) using `pip install <package>`:
```console
pip install mkdocs-material

pip install mike
```
<br>

Then, you will need to fork the repository (by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top-left) and clone your forked repository locally with `git clone <repo>`. You can then make new branches and/or change the files inside your forked repository. For example, let's say that you forked the repository and your username is `generic-username123`:
```console
git clone https://github.com/generic-username123/eggolib.github.io

cd eggolib.github.io
```

You can view the changes you made with `mike serve`:
```console
mike serve
```
