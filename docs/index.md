#   Welcome to eggolib's Documentation!

This documentation extends the information given by the [**documentation for the Origins mod**][1]. It's recommended that you familiarize yourself with developing a datapack using Origins/Apoli so that you know how exactly stuff works.

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me in Discord *(`eggohito#9048`)*, mention me in the `#addon-support` channel of the [**Origins Discord server**][2], or open up a [**discussion**][3]/[**issue**][4] in the [**GitHub repository**][5] for eggolib.
