#   Welcome to eggolib's Documentation!

This documentation extends the information given by the **[documentation for the Origins mod]**. It's recommended that you familiarize yourself with developing a datapack using Origins/Apoli so that you know how exactly stuff works.

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me in Discord *(`eggohito#9048`)*, mention me in the `#addon-support` channel of the **[Origins Discord server]**, or open up a **[discussion]**/**[issue]** in the **[GitHub repository]** for eggolib.
