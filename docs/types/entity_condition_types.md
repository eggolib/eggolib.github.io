#   Entity Condition Types

Entity condition types operate on an `Entity`, which allows access to the `World`. These are used in most powers in the `condition` *(or `entity_condition`, for other power/action/condition types)* [**object**][1] field, which restricts when a power is active.

!!! note
    
    See the documentation for [**Origins/Apoli's entity condition types**][2] for a list of entity condition types added by Origins/Apoli.
