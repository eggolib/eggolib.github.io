#   Bi-entity Condition Types

Bi-entity condition types operate on a `Pair<Entity, Entity>` or in simpler terms: an '**actor**' and a '**target**'. The '**actor**' and the '**target**' is determined by the used power type and can be swapped. These are available to power/action/condition types that provides a `bientity_condition` **[object]** field.

!!! note

    See the documentation for **[Origins/Apoli's bi-entity condition types]** for a list of bi-entity condition types added by Origins/Apoli.
