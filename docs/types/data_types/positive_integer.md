#   Positive Integer

[**Data Type**][1]

A whole number, like 3 or 10, that cannot be negative.


### Examples

=== "Example #1"

    ``` json
    {
        "type": "eggolib:game_event_listener",
        "range": 16
    }
    ```

    This example is a power that uses the [Game Event Listener (Power Type)][2] with a `range` value of `16`, which is a positive integer.
