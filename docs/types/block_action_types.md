#   Block Action Types

Block action types operate on a `Triple<World, BlockPos, Direction>`, which allows for modifying a block at a certain `World` and/or `BlockPos`. These are available to power/action/condition types that provides a `block_action` [**object**][1] field.

!!! note

    See the documentation for [**Origins/Apoli's block action types**][2] for a list of block action types added by Origins/Apoli.
