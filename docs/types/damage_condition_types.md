#   Damage Condition Types

Damage condition types operate on a `Pair<DamageSource, Float>`, allowing to check not only the source of the damage dealt but also how much damage was dealt. These are available to power/condition types that provides a `damage_condition` [**object**][1] field.

!!! note

    See the documentation for [Origins/Apoli's damage condition types][2] for a list of damage condition types added by Origins/Apoli.
