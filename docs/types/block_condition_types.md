#   Block Condition Types

Block condition types operate on a `CachedBlockPosition`, essentially a combination of `World` and `BlockPos`, which allows retrieving all necessary information about a certain block. These are available to power/action/condition types that provide a `block_condition` **[object]** field.


!!! note

    See the documentation for **[Origins/Apoli's block condition types]** for a list of block condition types added by Origins/Apoli.
