#   Item Action Types

Item action types operate on a `Pair<World, ItemStack>`, which allows for modification of the item stack and accessing data from the world. These are available to power/action types that provide an `item_action` [**object**][1] field.


!!! note

    See the documentation for [**Origins/Apoli's item action types**][2] for a list of item action types added by Origins/Apoli.
